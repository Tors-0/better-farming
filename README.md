# Rae's Better Farming
Tweaks and updates to Minecraft's farming system are as follows:
### Any Hoe can be used to right-click harvest:
- Wheat, Carrots, Potatoes, Beetroot (and most modded crops)
- Sugar Cane
- Cocoa Beans
- Nether Wart
### Sickles!
- Crafted with any Sword and a Hammer
  - Hammers can be found in villages or obtained from toolsmiths at Master level via trading
- Have innate looting and amplified sweeping damage
- Till ground in a 5-block plus shape
- Harvest crops like a Hoe, but in a 5-block plus shape
- Deal moderate damage at a somewhat slow speed
### Shears can be used to right-click harvest:
- Vines, Twisting Vines, Weeping Vines
### Crops on well hydrated farmland grow faster
- This depends on how much hydrated farmland is nearby
- The boost is always chance based, even crops fully surrounded by hydrated farmland aren't guaranteed a boost
